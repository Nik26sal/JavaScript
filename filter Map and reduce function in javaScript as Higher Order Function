-->> filter
         const variableName = arrayName.filter((key) => condition)
         // the variable name is required bcz it return array
         // key is required 
         // if the condition are in {condition} then use return at last oterwise 
            it return []
            //example const VariableName = ArrayName.filter((key)=>{return condition});
                      console.log(Variable Name);
          // it retun the value when the condition is true
-->> map
           const variableName = arrayName.map((key) => condition)
           return array
           same as filter
           chaning is done in it

-->> reduce
          initialValue = 0
          const Variable name = arrayName.reduce((accumulator,currentValue) => accumulator+currentValue,InitialValue)
          return the sum of all the element in the array or object;
          accumulator have the value that present in initial value
          after doing the work the answer stored in initial value that value sored in accumulator also
          current value have the element in the array
