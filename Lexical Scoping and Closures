Closures---
            a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

Lexical Scoping---
                  example of lexical Scoping--

                      function init() {
                            var name = "Mozilla"; // name is a local variable created by init
                            function displayName() {
                                // displayName() is the inner function, that forms the closure
                                console.log(name); // use variable declared in the parent function
                             }
                             displayName();
                      }

            calling outer Function---          init();

--In my Word -- Lexical Scoping means child have Access of Parent variables , functions,etc. but parent does not have access the variables,functions of child.
--In the given example inner function(displayName) have Access the 'name' Variable which present in the parent function(init);
--In the Lexical Scoping Sibling also have Access of Parent Variablesand functions  but it does not have Access of their Sibling variable and functions.

closures -- 
           example--

                    function makeFunc() {
                           const name = "Mozilla";
                           function displayName() {
                                   console.log(name);
                           }
                           return displayName;
                    }

    calling the function ---   const myFunc = makeFunc();
                                 myFunc();

output ---------------------------//   Mozilla

--In the given Example when we return the inner fuction then by the concept of closures and Lexical Scoping the outer 
  function(makeFunc) not give the inner function(displayName) only.It give inner function (displayName) with their Lexical Scoping.
  means the inner function have access of parent function things(variables,function) during its return time.
