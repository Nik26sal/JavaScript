-- Two type of Execution context is present :-
                                 1.Global Execution context
                                 2.Functional Execution context
                                 3.Eval Execution Context
--The Global Execution Context done in two phase :--
                                                    1.Memory management phase
                                                                            -In this phase the all the variables are assigned with value undefined
                                                                            -The function is assigned with defination.
                                                    2.Execution phase
                                                                   -In this phase all the Variables assigned their values. 
                                                                   -On the calling of the function new execution context is been develope.
                                                                   -The value is return to the global execution context after completion of call and this is assigned to the variable by this
                                                                   who call the function.

--During the execution of a program, the Global Execution Context is created. 
  In this context, the this keyword refers to the global object, which is why console.log(this) prints the window object.
